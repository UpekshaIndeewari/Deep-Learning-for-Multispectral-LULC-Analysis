# Deep-Learning-for-Multispectral-LULC-Analysis
This repository contains a deep learning workflow for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification using Landsat 8 and 9 imagery. The project leverages multispectral satellite data, spectral indices, and digital elevation models (DEM) to train a Conv1D neural network for accurate land cover mapping.
